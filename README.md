# JavaTest
Test case for Intern Java Developer

# Description
GUI app (I use JavaFX) for searching text in log-files at certain directory, and open file for reading.

For optimizing searching text in log files I use something like buffered reader. As a element for reading text-file I have chosen TextArea.

Using JavaFX was interested for me (that was my 1st javafx-project), and it helps me improve my UI and multithreading skills. I'm glad to study something new.
